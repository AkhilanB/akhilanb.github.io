## About

> Iâ€™m a PhD student in the EECS department at MIT advised by Ila Fiete. I received my masters in 2022 and my bachelors in 2020 from EECS in MIT as well. As an undergrad, I did research focusing on quantifying and enhancing adversarial robustness of artificial neural networks as well as investigating biologically plausible learning algorithms for neural networks.

> Nowadays, I work at the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning. I hope to develop machine learning models that achieve similar levels of generalization and robustness as biological neural networks.
